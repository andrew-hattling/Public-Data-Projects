    "## Background\n",
    "To effectively manage risk and returns, it is important to know how a rate hike/cut will impact the price of bonds in a portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "A major component of a bond's price is its yield. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bond yields have two major components: \n",
    "- The risk free rate\n",
    "- The market risk premium\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Fed changes interest rates, it changes the risk free rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Duration is a measure of how sensitive a bond's price is to changes in interest rates. Calculating duration is complicated and beyond the scope of this python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bond funds are required to disclose duration and the information can be accessed through Yahoo Finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The following formula is used to calculate how much a bond's price will change in response to a rate cut/hike. "
